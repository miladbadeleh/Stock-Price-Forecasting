# Stock Price Forecasting Project

An interactive web application for forecasting stock prices using statistical and machine learning models.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Data Acquisition:** Fetches historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.
*   **Dual Modeling Approach:**
    *   **Facebook Prophet:** A powerful additive regression model for time series forecasting with built-in seasonality handling.
    *   **LSTM Neural Network:** A deep learning model (Recurrent Neural Network) designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Uses Plotly to create interactive candlestick charts and forecast plots.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Calculates and displays key performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) on a holdout test set.
*   **Web UI:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Data:** yfinance
*   **Visualization:** Plotly, Matplotlib
*   **Statistical Modeling:** Prophet
*   **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
*   **Web App:** Streamlit

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

1.  Clone the repo and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run stock_forecaster.py
    ```
3.  Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL), select a date range, choose models, and generate forecasts!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.** The forecasts generated by these models are not guaranteed to be accurate and should **not** be used for making actual financial or investment decisions. Stock prices are influenced by a vast number of unpredictable factors.

## üéØ Project Structure

The project follows a standard time series forecasting pipeline:
1.  **Data Collection:** Fetch OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize historical trends and volatility.
3.  **Preprocessing:** Prepare data for models (normalization, creating supervised learning sets for LSTM).
4.  **Modeling:**
    *   **Prophet:** Fits an additive model decomposing trend and seasonality.
    *   **LSTM:** Trains a neural network to predict the next value based on a window of previous values.
5.  **Forecasting:** Generates future predictions.
6.  **Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance on unseen data (test set).
7.  **Visualization & Deployment:** Presents results in an interactive web app.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

*   Incorporate technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) as features for the LSTM model.
*   Add sentiment analysis from news headlines or social media.
*   Experiment with more advanced models like Transformer networks.
*   Deploy the app publicly on Streamlit Community Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
